# Binance Futures trading_bot (Spot market not fully implemented)
Simple trading GUI bot for Binance API with lots of features to plot data. For the moment simple price change strategies are used to open trades. More strategies can be added.

Simply launch from the python terminal pump_dump_pyqt_lite.py

Configure the BOT with Binance API key and set the trade settings according to your preference.

Multiple data plotting is provided to understand price change. I will soon make a detailed descriptive blog on the working and configuring of the BOT. For now, feel free to use it. 

The coding is done very haphazardly. Works very well in both bull and bear market, however the user must properly choose which market to configure the bot.
